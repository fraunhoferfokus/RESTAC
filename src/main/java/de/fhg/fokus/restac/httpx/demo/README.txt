Package de.fhg.fokus.restac.httpx.demo contains sample classes 
for the demonstration of the features of the httpx.core and httpx.util
packages

How to use:

Example 1 (accessing an external web service with a REST interface):
Execute FlickrSearchServiceWrapper, don't forget to replace the Flickr API key 
(available at http://www.flickr.com/).

Example 2 (writing your own server and client):
ServerApplication and ClientApplication show some (non-functional) examples how
plain / syn / asyn requests and responses are used.
